# This configuration file configures the
# system. It's mostly concerned with
# network setup and names.

# The document must be a valid python data
# structure. You can verify this by running
#
# python3 system.conf

# There should be exactly no output! Any error-messages

    # filter keys in this configuration. Keys followed by ":<number>"
    # are only active if that is the number selected via this config
    # selector. Currently this is just a string of the form
    #
    # <number><low-or-high>[,<number><low-or-high>]*

    # letter L or H.

    # both low-active, meaning a switch connected to them must pull
    # them low to count as True.
